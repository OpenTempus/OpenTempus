Welcome to OpenTempus, the open source technology used by Agrolly.

[Agrolly LLC](https://prometeoplatform.com/) created its solution as a [Call for Code submission](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/solutions/agrolly/) that won the top prize in the Global Challenge. In 2022, **_OpenTempus_** was contributed to the Linux Foundation as the open source core of Agrolly in order share the technology and provide a way for others to improve it for the benefit of all.

[The OpenTempus mission](Pyrrha-Technical-Charter-July-2021.pdf) is to provide smallholder farmers with the information they need to make better decisions about what to plant and when to plant helping them to mitigate the impacts of a changing climate.

## OpenTempus and Agrolly

The first version of the Pyrrha project has been released as a [Call for CodeÂ® with The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/call-for-code/) project. Pyrrha will carry on as a separate name distinct from the Prometeo Solutions trademark, the [flame-colored haired daughter-in-law of Prometheus in Greek mythology](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Pyrrha/pyrrha.html).

## The story

Watch this video to learn about the Pyrrha solution based on Prometeo's original Call for Code 2019 winning application:
