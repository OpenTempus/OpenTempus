Welcome to OpenTempus, the open source technology used by Agrolly.

[Agrolly LLC](https://prometeoplatform.com/) created its solution as a [Call for Code submission](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/solutions/agrolly/) that won the top prize in the Global Challenge. In 2022, **_OpenTempus_** was contributed to the Linux Foundation as the open source core of Agrolly in order share the technology and provide a way for others to improve it for the benefit of all.

[The OpenTempus mission](Pyrrha-Technical-Charter-July-2021.pdf) is to provide smallholder farmers with the information they need to make better decisions about what to plant and when to plant helping them to mitigate the impacts of a changing climate.
