  "architectureTitle": "OpenTempus in a nutshell",
  "architectureDescription": "A two-way system that collects toxin readings, analyzes them, and sends actionable data back to the team.",
  "architectureDescription1": "1. The firefighter logs into the ruggedized Samsung smartphone via IBM App ID. Devices are paired through Bluetooth.",
  "architectureDescription2": "2. The device sensors capture toxin levels. The device sends stored readings to the phone at regular intervals.",
  "architectureDescription3": "3. The mobile application relays data to the IBM IoT platform.",
  "architectureDescription4": "4. The MQTT client service listens for incoming messages from the IBM IoT platform.",
  "architectureDescription5": "5. The MQTT client stores the data in the MariaDB relational database.",
  "architectureDescription6": "6. The MQTT client sends the data to the WebSocket server.",
  "architectureDescription7": "7. The Rules-Decision service wakes up every minute to calculate the 10 mins, 30 mins, 60 mins, 4 hours, and 8 hours time-weighted averages for each gas.",
  "architectureDescription8": "8. The dashboard queries the database to show the historical data.",
  "architectureDescription9": "9. The dashboard connects to the WebSocket Server to show live data and alerts the user if the levels go above certain pre-determined thresholds.",
  "architectureDescription10": "10. The command center can view the dashboard using the web browser on a laptop or tablet.",
  "architectureDescription11": "11. The mobile application regularly requests status from the Rules-Decision service and emits the result via device LED and Samsung phone/watch vibrations.",
